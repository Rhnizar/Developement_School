### HTML is a programming language ?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is not a programming language; itâ€™s a markup language.
Markup languages are designed to format and structure content on the web. 
While HTML provides the essential structure and layout of a webpage (such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more), 
it doesn't contain logic or control flow, which are key components of programming languages.

In contrast, programming languages like JavaScript, Python, or C++ include logic, allowing you to create dynamic functionality, 
perform calculations, and manipulate data. They enable developers to write algorithms, manage data flow, and handle user interactions, which HTML alone cannot do.


## The difference between "link" and "a" tags in HTML lies in their purpose and usage:

### 1 "link" Tag:
- **Purpose:**  The "link" tag is used to link external resources to the HTML document, such as stylesheets (CSS), icons, or other external files.

- **Usage:** Commonly placed inside the "head" section of an HTML document to apply styles from a CSS file or to include other external resources.

- **Attributes:**

- rel: Defines the relationship between the current document and the linked file (e.g., stylesheet for CSS).

- href: Specifies the path to the external resource (e.g., a CSS file).

### Example:

```bash
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

### 2 "a" Tag:
- **Purpose:** The "a" tag is used to create hyperlinks that users can click to navigate to other webpages, files, or locations within the same page.

- **Usage:** Typically used in the body of an HTML document to create a clickable link.

- **Attributes:**
- href: Specifies the URL or path to the destination (e.g., another webpage or section of the same page).

### Example:

```bash
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```
