## The difference between "<link>" and "<a>" tags in HTML lies in their purpose and usage:

### 1 link Tag:
**. Purpose:**  The <link> tag is used to link external resources to the HTML document, such as stylesheets (CSS), icons, or other external files.

**. Usage:** Commonly placed inside the <head> section of an HTML document to apply styles from a CSS file or to include other external resources.

**. Attributes:**

    - rel: Defines the relationship between the current document and the linked file (e.g., stylesheet for CSS).
    
    - href: Specifies the path to the external resource (e.g., a CSS file).
**Example:**
```bash
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```
