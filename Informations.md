## The difference between "link" and "a" tags in HTML lies in their purpose and usage:

### 1 "link" Tag:
- **Purpose:**  The "link" tag is used to link external resources to the HTML document, such as stylesheets (CSS), icons, or other external files.

- **Usage:** Commonly placed inside the "head" section of an HTML document to apply styles from a CSS file or to include other external resources.

- **Attributes:**

- rel: Defines the relationship between the current document and the linked file (e.g., stylesheet for CSS).

- href: Specifies the path to the external resource (e.g., a CSS file).

### Example:

```bash
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

### 2 "a" Tag:
- **Purpose:** The "a" tag is used to create hyperlinks that users can click to navigate to other webpages, files, or locations within the same page.

- **Usage:** Typically used in the body of an HTML document to create a clickable link.

- **Attributes:**
- href: Specifies the URL or path to the destination (e.g., another webpage or section of the same page).

### Example:

```bash
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```
